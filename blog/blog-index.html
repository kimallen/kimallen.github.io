				<h2>About Launching from Zero</h2>
				<p>Welcome to my first blog on my first "from-scratch" website.  As someone new to programming, I really feel like I started from zero.  And with the rate at which I'm learning, it's definitely a "launch."</p>
				<p>In my early blogs, I explore technical concepts new to me with the intent of addressing others who may be new to programming.  As the concepts get more advanced, the explanations require more technical vocabulary, but I try to keep the language as accessible as possible.  By blogging soon after having a true beginner's mind, my hope is that I am able to more effectively relay concepts than someone with years of experience.</p>
