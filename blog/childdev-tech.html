			<H2>Child Development and Tech</H2>
			<h4>September 14, 2015</h4>
			<p>A couple weeks ago, I was flying on a plane across the U.S, laptop on tray.  On my right was a mother and her 4 year old son.  Across the aisle on my left was the father and their two other sons, around 6 and 8 years old.  I found myself in a tunnel of technology, me with my laptop studying computer programming, the kids watching or playing on tablets, and Dad with phone in hand the majority of the flight.  Despite the fact that I am currently spending many hours per day studying computer programming to lead to a life of spending more time in front of a screen to hopefully contribute positively to the world, I believe that our society is in danger because of the pervasiveness of screen technology.</p>

			<p>We as human beings were hard-wired as hunters and gatherers.  The way we learn and process information evolved not in the last 100 years but over hundreds of thousands of years.  We are sensory creatures who learn through interaction of those senses with the outside world.  Childhood is the time when the most learning happens.   Child development is vastly influenced by how children interact with the world around them.  We need different types of stimulation in order for our brains to develop properly.  For healthy development, children need regular movement, touch, human connection, and exposure to nature.  They need unstructured imaginative play.  Through those activities their minds, bodies, and hearts develop.  How a child’s body develops affects how their mind develops.  Certainly the physical heart organ is strengthened by active play, but just as importantly children learn to have a heart-they learn empathy through direct social interaction. </p>

			<p>What happens when a child’s empathy is stunted?  What does it look like when an entire society’s ability to empathize, read social cues, and communicate socially is reduced?  I fear a society where the average screen time for children is four hours per day.  Although there are potential detrimental effects of television and internet use on attention and thinking, I am most concerned about what learning and development is being surplanted by screen time.  Certainly technology can be used as a tool for learning, but it cannot be a substitute for essential child development.</p>

			<p>As we navigate this rapidly exploding technology-based culture, I believe we need to continue to ask good questions and not look to technology as the answer.  Here are just a few questions that come to mind: when and how much technology is helpful?  When is it harmful?  What types are helpful and harmful?  What tools are available for limiting screen time for kids surrounded by it?  What role should screens play in education and at what age?  How do we encourage non-screen time in this busy fast-paced world where it’s often just easier to plop your kid in front of a computer?</p>

			<p>As I continually observed the father on the plane with a hand-held screen holding his attention for hours, I wondered what kinds of interaction he could be having instead with the two children beside him.  What about “I spy?”  What about story-telling?  How could they be building their relationship? I recognize I too might opt for utilizing technology to get through a long plane flight with small children.  Who knows how they interact and live their lives off the plane.  I do believe we need to make a conscious effort as both individuals and a society to ensure that technology is used as a tool appropriately and prudently with children to complement, not substitute for, the essential healthy developmental activities.</p>
