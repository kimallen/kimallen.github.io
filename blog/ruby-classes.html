			<H2>0.5: With Class, for Instance</H2>
			<h4><time datetime="2015-09-26">September 9, 2015</time></h4>
			<p>	A class is an object that you can do stuff to: you can add methods to it and send messages to it.  Creating a new class allows you to create what is called an "instance."</p>  

			<p>For example, you may create a class called "Harvest" that calculates what was harvested in a week.  In one "instance,"  you would use class "Harvest" to calculate and record how much squash you harvested. In another "instance," you would record how many cucumbers you harvested.  In this case, instance is a record and in others it might be an occurrence, like the rolling of a die.   Here's a code example:</p>
			
			<pre><code>class Harvest
def initialize (crop, first_harvest, second_harvest, third_harvest)
@crop = crop
@first_harvest = first_harvest
@second_harvest = second_harvest
@third_harvest = third_harvest
end

def total_lbs
@total_lbs = @first_harvest + @second_harvest + @third_harvest
puts "You harvested #{@total_lbs}lbs of #{@crop} this week."
end
end</code></pre>

			Here, we defined the crop and each harvest for the week in the initialize method.  In order to calculate how many total pounds were harvested, you need to refer to the harvests and the crop in the total_lbs method.  You need to use an instance variable (recognized by the @ preceding the variable name) so that it can be used in other methods within the class Harvest.  @weight will be recognized in any method in class Harvest, but not outside of Harvest.  total_lbs is an instance method.  It can be called when calling an instance of Harvest.  For example:
			
			<pre><code>squash = Harvest.new (crop, first_harvest, second_harvest, third_harvest)
squash.total_lbs("squash", 55, 47, 60)</code></pre>

			<p>- squash is an instance of the class Harvest</p>
			<p>- total_lbs is an instance method from the class Harvest</p>
			<p>- @crop (and @first_harvest, etc.) is an instance variable utilized inside of total_lbs, an instance method of the
  			class Harvest.</p>

			<p>The operations performed in Harvest are only applied in this instance called squash.  In another instance, it might be tomatoes.</p>
