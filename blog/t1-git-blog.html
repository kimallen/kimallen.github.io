      The idea is pretty simple.  Git is basically a way that you can save different drafts of things and easily go back to the different versions.  Imagine you are writing a story.  You want to change a paragraph, but are concerned your new paragraph is going to make less sense than the first.  So, you save the old version and the new version in your word processor.  Rather than saving multiple documents, git organizes your different versions and allows you to go back to old onces if you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another feature of git is that the versions can be shared or edited by multiple people and they can make changes and share them without having a mess of files to keep track of.  Each version, or "commit" as it's called in git, is given a description so that you know what it is you were changing in any particular draft.  Git is found on your local computer.

      GitHub is something that is what the name implies (once you actually know what "git" is).  A hub is where the spokes of a wheel come together.  If a group of people is working on a project, GitHub offers a central place to put it.  Each person (or version) might represent a spoke of the wheel.  Eventually it is received at the central, or master location.  GitHub exists in the cloud so that everyone working on a project can reach up into that cloud and pull the latest draft down to the local computer at his/her fingertips.  After making your own edits, you can push your version back up to that designated cloud so that others can access the changes you made and everyone's changes can be combined into one congruent whole.  Everyone's suggested edits don't necessarily get automatically accepted- as you can imagine, that could be disastrous.  For example, if I say "here, try this peanut butter on your melon, it will really improve your meal."  I push the tub of peanut butter to you.  You can choose to try it out by pulling that tub towards you and applying (or merging) the peanut butter with your melon or not.  Whoever sits at the center of the hub does then have to accept your version by, in the language of git fulfilling your "pull request." 
    </p>
    <p>The most advantageous reason to store your code on GitHub is that it can be easily shared.  However, even if you are working on a project that only you are going to see, you can easily look at the different versions which you have labeled and marked.</p>

       I best understand the steps to utilizing git and GitHub by making cute drawings of clouds and computer monitors and drawing flow arrows.  But I can't pretend to share my technical know-how by showing you some digital drawing.  Maybe one day I'll post a photo of my handdrawn clouds and arrows.
