			<h2>Accessible: Developing for All</h2>
			<h4>October 11, 2015</h4>
			<p>As we embark on a new career in web development and programming, it is important to understand the value in and opportunities for making the meaningful and beautiful things we build available to as many people as possible.  Accessibility can refer to device, language, and disability considerations.  Disabilities to consider include auditory, cognitive, neural, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.  Here I will address some of the most prominent considerations and means for creating accessible websites.<p>

			<h4>Guidelines and the importance of accessibility</h4>
			<p>W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, is an international organization that develops standards and guidelines for the web.   Their program <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">WAI</a>, the Web Accessibility Initiative, is developing guidelines and techniques for accessibility solutions and are create what is considered the international standard for accessibility  They have compiled a document called <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components.php">"Essential Components of Web Accessibility"</a>.  This includes users, developers, assistive technology, software, web browsers, and content.  Below I highlight some of the ways we as developers can address accessibility.</p>

			<p>For front-end developers, accessibility starts with good design.  A good user experience for anyone is linked to making a good user experience for those with disabilities.  Two main tasks that users need to do is read information and to provide command or data-level input.  Information should all be accessible by keyboard rather than the mouse alone.  The American Foundation for the Blind incorporates several simple components in their own website.  This includes giving a text alternative for all images, labeling forms clearly and correctly,  offering viewing alternatives for multi-media and transcripts for all videos, the ability to change text size and change colors, and optimization for mobile devices. </p> 

			<h4>Semantic HTML and ARIA</h4>
			<p>Clarissa Peterson provides a great <a href="http://www.clarissapeterson.com/2012/11/html5-accessibility/"> article</a> addressing HTML in Accessibility.  One of the simplest ways of considering the visually impaired is to provide alternative text for all images.  Peterson stresses the importance of providing meaningful text.  Rather than describing the image, use text that conveys the meaning of the image in the context of the page.  Using semantic HTML is vital.  The visually impaired often use a screenreader, which reads the contents of the page out loud.  If sections are appropriately labeled with headers, a person's screen reader can read through just the headings without having to read all the content.  Then the person can choose what to read further.  Following the standard of separating CSS and HTML also makes your design more accessible. </p>

			<p>HTML5 facilitates better screen-reading capability, but is not supported by all browsers and we can't assume that everyone updates their browsers.  There is an older resource called ARIA, the WAI- Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, that is supported by most browsers.  So, one way to use HTML code that is more accessible is to use both HTML5 and ARIA.  Take Peterson's example of a header.  In HTML5 you can use &lt;header&gt;.  In ARIA, you would use &lt;div role = "banner"&gt; to indicate the header.  To utilize both, you can use &lt;header role = "banner"&gt;.  Here is more on using <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/02/using-wai-aria-landmarks-2013/"> ARIA's landmark roles</a>.  Another consideration with the header/banner is the CSS applied to it.  Browsers displays all unknown elements, like divs, or (or headers when they don't support HTML5) automatically as inline.  A &lt;header&gt; in HTML5 is defined as a block.  So, rather than solely using header under the assumption that it is a block, know that an older browser won't be able to identify it as such and be sure to designate the header display mode in the CSS as a block.</p>

			<p>For images, using &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; allows screen-readers to associate the caption text with the image.  For videos and audio, using &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements means it's more likely the browser allows the controls to be keyboard accessible. HTML5 supports native playing of audio and video rather than embedding or using a plugin, which sometimes are dependent on a mouse for controls.  On forms, since the visually impaired need to know what to enter, using the elements &lt;label&gt; for form fields, &lt;fieldset&gt; for checkboxes, and &lt;legend&gt; for radio buttons indicates to a user through the screen reader what information is being requested.   See Peterson's article for more details.</p>

			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p> In summary, when developing sites, considering the following can assure better accessibility to more people:
			  <ul>
			    <li>implement techniques in initial product development phase</li>
				<li>Use standard user-interface elements</li>
				<li> Use a flexible user interface (re: color, contrast, font size, cursor style, and blink rate)</li>
			  	<li>Allow full keyboard navigation</li>
			  	<li>Label all graphics and icons</li>
			  </ul>
			<p>(See <a href="http://www.afb.org/info/accessibility/creating--accessible-computer-applications/25">AFB website for more details)</a></p>

			<p>The internet has expanded opportunity for work and access to resources for people with disabilities, but only to the extent that we do our part as developers to make it accessible.</p>
