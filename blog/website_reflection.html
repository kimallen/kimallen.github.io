			<H2>Made from Scratch: A Website for Me</H2>
			<h4><time datetime="2015-10-17">October 17, 2015</time></h4>
			<p>Building a website from scratch is quite gratifying.  I personally really like to understand how things work.  I love my bike because I can see and understand all it's workings.  If something breaks, I know how to fix it.  When I got my first car, I was determined to fix whatever I could, but it was certainly disempowering to have something I didn't fully understand for which I needed to rely on others to tell me what was wrong with it.</p>

			<p>I have built websites utilizing Drupal and Wordpress, but there were so many "manufactured parts" on them that if they broke or didn't work the way I wanted, I didn't know how to fix them.  Having built my own website from basic html and having applied all of the CSS myself, I know where to look when something breaks and can troubleshoot it myself.  That's not to say the process has been without frustration.  Indeed, after my first week using CSS to try to move elements where I wanted, I was sure I was too traumatized by the experience to ever go back.  But, I found new resources, pushed my head forward, actually found some satisfaction using it, and look forward to when I get a chance to learn new tricks.  </p>

			<p>That really is the ebb and flow of development: you attempt something, you run into roadblocks, do some research, get frustrated, take a break, go back with fresh eyes, try again, find immense satisfaction in figuring it out, hit more frustration and roadblocks, take a breath, and keep on learning.  It's the part of my personality that loves that cycle, as aggravating as it can be, and thrives on the continual learning process that is development, that brought me to this field in the first place.  </p>
