What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that margins can be confusing because they may not be visible, but can bump other elements over unknowingly, so one must keep in mind the margins when positioning elements.  Padding and borders are a bit more simple and are more about visual effect, whereas a margin can sometimes be used to help position in relation to other elements.  I also learned that when adding a border, it adds to the overall dimensions of an element, so if you don't want the dimensions to change when adding one, adding the CSS command box-sizing: border-box; can remedy that.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
That it is REALLY challenging and confusing.  I still don't feel like I have the hang of it.  There was a ton of trial and error.  One big challenge after spending hours positioning is that you have to do it a certain way in order for it to translate to different sized browser windows.  Getting it looking right in one window doesn't mean it translates to others.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest was to implement color.  The most challenging was positioning, and doing so such that it shows up properly in different windows and on different devices.
What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Formatting elements themselves was not so hard outside of the positioning of them.  Adding colors and borders could be fun.  I'm not sure what this question means about adding elements in CSS.  My understanding is that we only add elements in HTML, then format them in CSS.
